## Introduction

Welcome to **Loan-Eligibility-Prediction**! Let's predict whether a loan ID is eligible or not based on factors such as ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, and more. My goal is to submit a report to my client, who is a bank manager. This report should help them efficiently decide whether to approve an application or not in a short amount of time. Let's get started.

## Getting Started

Just a few steps to get you up and running with the project:

1. **Clone** this repository.
2. **Run** in the `Jupiter notebook` or `Google Collab notebook`.
3. **import** all the `files`, `packages`, and `libraries`.
4. **Run** all the cell.
